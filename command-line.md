The command line is a way to work on the computer to create, move, delete, etc directories and files. You can use it to tell the computer to do pretty much anything that you can using a mouse and keyboard.

pwd             Shows the path of the current directory
cd zyx          Changes to directory zyx
cd ~            Changes to the parent directory

rm ex1.txt      Deletes ex1.txt
rm -r xyz       Deletes directory xyz
cp ex1 xyz      Copies file ex1 to directory xyz
